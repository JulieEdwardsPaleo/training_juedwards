## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: true

2*2

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r important r code }

x<-c(2,3,4)

```

my result is `r x` (this is an inline)


Example text that looks like code `hello world!`
